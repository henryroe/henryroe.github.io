# Dr. Henry Roe

I am Deputy Director of [Gemini Observatory](https://gemini.edu), a program of [NSF's NOIRLab](https://noirlab.edu). When I have time for research, my interests include Pluto, Titan, and other objects in the outer solar system. I have fun with high-resolution spectroscopy, especially in the near- and mid-infrared, complicated molecules, and making telescopes of all sizes do cool things.

You can follow me on twitter as [@_hroe](http://twitter.com/_hroe).
