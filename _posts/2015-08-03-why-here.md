Over the years I've blogged intermittently at [henrysmac](http://henrysmac.org), originally hosted in wordpress on some now forgotten VPS, then later at [SquareSpace](http://squarespace.com).  I'll keep the site live there for at least some time to come, but I won't be adding more to it there.  I've realized I want more control and less complexity. So, at least for now, my plan is to migrate to here at [hroe.me](http://hroe.me) served from [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Over time I will likely migrate some posts over from  [henrysmac](http://henrysmac.org).  And, some other day I will address the issue of link rot from [henrysmac](http://henrysmac.org) before I eventually decide to stop paying [SquareSpace](http://squarespace.com).  (Absolutely *nothing* against [SquareSpace](http://squarespace.com).  They are a useful service and I will continue to use them for other projects.  They just weren't serving my needs for my personal blog and website.)
