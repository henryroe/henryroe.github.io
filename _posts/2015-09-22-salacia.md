[Salacia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120347_Salacia) is a fun object.  It's almost certainly big enough to be a [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet).  It has a moon named [Actaea](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.398.6675&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  And, it's at opposition today.  Because Salacia is on the outbound half of its orbit right now, this is the closest it will be in the remainder of our lifetimes.  It won't be until about 2105 that it gets this close again.

Oh, and, Salacia is special to me because I discovered it.  We weren't looking for it.  We were looking for something else, which we didn't find.  But, that's sometimes how science progresses.
