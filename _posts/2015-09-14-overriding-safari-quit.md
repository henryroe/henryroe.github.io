I tend to work across *a lot* of Spaces in Mission Control.  I tend to have *a lot* of Safari windows open across those Spaces.  I tend to be hamfisted with my fingers on the keyboard.  I curse *a lot* when I accidentally hit ⌘-Q and close *all* my Safari windows at once that had been carefully distributed across those Spaces.

I don't know why this didn't occur to me until today, but I just remapped *Quit* in Safari from ⌘-Q to ⌘^⌥-Q.  Now I can accidentally bang away on ⌘-Q all day in Safari with *no* impact on people in nearby offices. 

The most straightforward way to do this is in *System Preferences*→*Keyboard*→*Shortcuts*→*App Shortcuts*, then click the +-button, type "Quit Safari" (exactly as it appears in Safari's menubar) and mash your desired key combo.  Here's what it should look like once you've done that:

I cannot believe I didn't think of doing this until today.  This sands away one of those sharp splinters I stab myself with at least once or twice per week.
