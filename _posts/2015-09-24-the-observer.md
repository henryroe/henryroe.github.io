On a warm pacific evening  
On a red eye  to the mainland  
I met up with an observer  
We were both too tired to sleep  
So we took turns a-starin'  
Out the window at the darkness  
Til boredom overtook us  
and she began to speak  

<!--more-->

She said kid I've made a life  
out of studying the planets  
And knowing which photons  
could best tell a story  
So if you don't mind my saying  
I can see you've had bad weather  
For a taste of your coffee  
I'll give you some advice  

So I handed her my Starbucks  
And she peaked under the lid  
Then took a cautious sip  
And said "At least it's true black  
From your look I would've took you  
For a macchiato latte  
caramel soy Grande  
with a splash of mint"  

You got to know when to open  
Know when to call it  
Know when to walk away  
From an observin' run  
You never count your photons  
'til they're safely on the hard drive  
They'll be time enough for analysis  
when the run is done.  

Now every observer knows  
That the secret to surviving  
Is staying optimistic and  
Assuming the clouds will clear  
But, every observer knows  
If the fog and humidity  
Don't kill ya, then an  
Instrument failure will.   

When the observer finished talking  
She turned back to the window  
Crushed up the coffee cup  
And drifted off to sleep  
Meanwhile I started writin'  
That very next proposal  
To hope to get some time  
When the sky is clear  

You got to know when to open  
Know when to call it  
Know when to walk away  
From an observin' run  
You never count your photons  
'til they're safely on the hard drive  
They'll be time enough for analysis  
when the run is done.
